				<!--the bio. it's billiant. trust. -->

			<p>Leigh Fisher is a yoga teacher, writer, interdisciplinary theatre artist, and burgeoning web developer from Austin, TX. Working in the theater world for nearly 30 years (she started VERY young, stop trying to do the math) has given Leigh a keen eye for design, and the ability to make somthing really cool with virtually no time and even less money. Leigh started using her writing and design skills to create Wellsites&trade; (health and wellness focused websites) in WordPress. She soon learned that a writer and designer who could also code was called a "Unicorn" so of course she immediately decided that was what she wanted to be when she grew up. And here we are.</p> 
		
		<br>
			<p>Leigh also quite likes punching things, and is working towards her orange belt in Krav Maga. So it's probalby a good idea to just smile and go along with whatever she says. </p>
